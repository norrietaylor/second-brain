# CLAUDE.md — Second Brain Installer

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on the **installer** repo (not the installed vault).

## What This Is

An installer that provisions Obsidian vaults as personal knowledge management systems. The installer copies template files into a user-chosen location, applies variable substitution, and sets up integrations.

## Template System

### Placeholders

Files in `template/` and `scaffold/` use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax:

| Placeholder | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{VAULT_NAME}}` | User input during install | `second-brain` |
| `{{USER_NAME}}` | User input during install | `Jane Smith` |
| `{{USER_FIRST_NAME}}` | Derived from USER_NAME | `Jane` |
| `{{USER_ROLE}}` | User input during install | `Staff Engineer` |
| `{{USER_EMAIL}}` | User input during install | `jane@company.com` |
| `{{PRIORITY_1..3}}` | Scaffold-only, user fills in | — |

### How it works

1. `lib/templating.sh` walks the `template/` tree
2. For each file, checks if it contains `{{...}}` patterns
3. If yes, runs sed substitution; if no, plain copy
4. `.tmpl` suffix is stripped from destination filenames

### Adding a new template variable

1. Add the placeholder to relevant files: `{{NEW_VAR}}`
2. Add the sed line in `apply_template_file()` in `lib/templating.sh`
3. Export `TPL_NEW_VAR` in `install.sh` before calling copy functions

## Integration System

Each integration is a named feature the user selects during install:

| Integration | Controls |
|---|---|
| `GitHub sync` | gh-onmyplate skill, gh-fetch script, gh-import command, GitHub.base |
| `GitLab sync` | gl-onmyplate skill |
| `Slack activity tracking` | slack-my-activity script, slack command |
| `Notion task tracking` | notion-onmyplate skill, notion-import command, Notion.base, notion.claude.md (MCP-based, no CLI) |
| `Granola meeting sync` | granola scripts, Granola.md template |
| `Git-backed vault` | .gitignore, git init, sb/upstream branch |

Disabled integrations exclude files via glob patterns in `copy_template_tree()`.

### Adding a new integration

1. Add option to the `gum choose` list in `install.sh` Step 2
2. Add exclusion patterns in `copy_template_tree()` in `lib/templating.sh`
3. Add setup function in `lib/integrations.sh`
4. Add config section in `generate_config()` in `lib/integrations.sh`

## Update Strategy

Updates are **one-directional: installer → vault**. The updater never reads changes from the vault back into the installer repo.

### What gets updated

- All files from `template/` are re-applied (with placeholder substitution)
- `scaffold/` files (user-owned) are **never overwritten** — they are only created on fresh install
- `configure_settings()` re-generates `settings.json` and Claude sandbox for current integrations
- `.sb-installer.json` version is bumped

### Adding integrations during update

`./install.sh --update` prompts the user to add integrations that were not selected on the original install. For any that are selected:

- `check_all_prerequisites` runs for just the newly-added integrations (so missing CLIs like `glab` can be brew-installed)
- `copy_template_tree` and `configure_settings` naturally pick up the expanded list
- `run_new_integrations_setup` runs the per-integration setup functions for only the new additions (avoids re-prompting Slack mode / GitLab host for already-configured ones)
- `generate_config` runs in append-only mode: missing sections (e.g. `granola:`) are appended to `config.yaml` without touching existing sections

### Git-backed vaults

Vaults with `.git` use a tracking branch strategy:

- `sb/upstream` — installer writes new template files here
- `main` — user's working branch

Flow:
1. Stash uncommitted changes if any
2. Check out `sb/upstream` (create if missing)
3. Copy new template files (with substitution) to vault
4. Commit to `sb/upstream`: `sb: update to vX.Y.Z`
5. Check out `main`, merge `sb/upstream`
6. If conflicts: report them — user resolves and commits manually
7. Pop stash

This means user edits to installer-managed files (e.g. a customised slash command) will surface as merge conflicts, which is intentional — the user chooses which version wins.

### Non-git vaults

`copy_template_tree()` overwrites installer-managed files directly. No conflict detection — any local edits to template-sourced files are silently overwritten.

## Key Conventions

- **Shell style**: bash, `set -euo pipefail`, functions over scripts
- **Commit prefix**: `sb:` for vault commits
- **gum dependency**: auto-installed via brew if missing
- **macOS assumed**: uses `sed -i ''` (BSD sed), `brew`, etc.

## Testing

Manual testing workflow:
```bash
# Fresh install to a temp directory
./install.sh
# Choose /tmp/test-vault as location

# Verify vault
ls /tmp/test-vault/.claude/commands/
grep -r 'vault=second-brain' /tmp/test-vault/ || echo "No hardcoded vault names"
obsidian vault=test-vault search query="type" path="05 Meta/claude" format=json | cat

# Update test
# Edit a template file, then:
./install.sh --update /tmp/test-vault
```
